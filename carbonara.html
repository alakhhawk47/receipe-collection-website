            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h3>Prepare the sauce base</h3>
                    <p>In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, egg yolks, grated Pecorino Romano, and Parmesan cheese. Season with a generous amount of freshly ground black pepper. Set aside.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Cook the pasta</h3>
                    <p>Bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook until al dente according to package instructions, usually 8-10 minutes.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Cook the pancetta</h3>
                    <p>While the pasta is cooking, heat a large, deep skillet over medium heat. Add the diced pancetta or guanciale and cook until crispy and the fat has rendered, about 5-7 minutes. Remove from heat but keep the pancetta in the pan.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Combine ingredients</h3>
                    <p>Before draining the pasta, reserve about 1 cup of the pasta cooking water. Drain the pasta and immediately add it to the skillet with the pancetta. Toss quickly to coat the pasta in the rendered fat.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Create the creamy sauce</h3>
                    <p>Allow the pasta to cool slightly (so it doesn't scramble the eggs), then quickly pour in the egg and cheese mixture, stirring constantly. Add about 1/4 cup of the reserved pasta water to create a creamy sauce. If needed, add more pasta water to reach your desired consistency.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Serve immediately</h3>
                    <p>Serve immediately, garnished with extra grated cheese and freshly ground black pepper.</p>

            <h2>Chef's Tips</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The key to a successful carbonara is working quickly and keeping the pasta moving to prevent the eggs from scrambling.</li>
                <li>Traditional carbonara does not contain cream – the creaminess comes from the eggs and cheese.</li>
                <li>Freshly grated cheese works much better than pre-packaged grated cheese for this recipe.</li>
