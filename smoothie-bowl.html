            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>A Berry Smoothie Bowl is a nutritious, Instagram-worthy breakfast that's as delicious as it is beautiful. Unlike regular smoothies, smoothie bowls are thicker in consistency and meant to be eaten with a spoon. This recipe features a vibrant base of mixed berries packed with antioxidants, topped with crunchy granola, fresh fruits, and superfoods for a perfect start to your day. It's customizable, satisfying, and provides sustained energy throughout the morning.</p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>For the smoothie base:</strong></li>
                <li>2 cups frozen mixed berries (strawberries, blueberries, raspberries)</li>
                <li>1 frozen banana</li>
                <li>1/2 cup Greek yogurt or plant-based yogurt</li>
                <li>1/4 cup milk of choice (dairy, almond, coconut, etc.)</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon honey or maple syrup (optional)</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon chia seeds (optional)</li>
                <li><strong>For toppings (choose your favorites):</strong></li>
                <li>1/4 cup granola</li>
                <li>Fresh berries (strawberries, blueberries, blackberries)</li>
                <li>Sliced banana</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon shredded coconut</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon pumpkin or sunflower seeds</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon nut butter (almond, peanut, cashew)</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon hemp seeds</li>
                <li>Edible flowers (for decoration, optional)</li>
                <li>A drizzle of honey or maple syrup</li>

            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h3>Prepare ingredients</h3>
                    <p>Make sure your banana and berries are frozen ahead of time for the best texture. If using fresh fruit, freeze them overnight. Choose and prepare your desired toppings.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Blend the base</h3>
                    <p>Place frozen berries, frozen banana, yogurt, and a splash of milk in a high-powered blender. Start with less milk than you think you need—you want a thick consistency that's spoonable, not drinkable.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Achieve the right consistency</h3>
                    <p>Blend on high, stopping to scrape down the sides as needed. Add milk a tablespoon at a time if the mixture is too thick to blend. The final consistency should be similar to soft-serve ice cream—thick enough to hold toppings without them sinking.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Taste and adjust</h3>
                    <p>Taste the smoothie base and add honey or maple syrup if more sweetness is needed. Add chia seeds now if using, and blend briefly to incorporate.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Pour and decorate</h3>
                    <p>Pour the smoothie mixture into two bowls. Work quickly before it starts to melt. Arrange your toppings in sections or rows for visual appeal—granola on one side, fresh fruit on another, seeds, coconut, and drizzle with nut butter and honey.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Serve immediately</h3>
                    <p>Serve your smoothie bowl right away while it's still cold and thick. For best presentation, take a photo before digging in!</p>

        <section class="recipe-tips">
            <h2>Chef's Tips</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>For an extra-thick smoothie bowl, freeze the yogurt in ice cube trays overnight.</li>
                <li>If you don't have a high-powered blender, let the frozen fruit thaw for 5 minutes before blending to prevent strain on your blender.</li>
                <li>Create themed bowls by color—try a "purple power bowl" with blueberries, blackberries and purple dragon fruit, or a "tropical bowl" with mango, pineapple and coconut.</li>
                <li>Prep freezer smoothie packs by portioning berries and banana pieces into containers or bags for quick morning assembly.</li>
                <li>For added protein, incorporate a tablespoon of protein powder or collagen peptides into the smoothie base.</li>
                <li>If your smoothie bowl melts too quickly, place the serving bowl in the freezer for 15 minutes before adding your smoothie.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Variations</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Green Smoothie Bowl:</strong> Add a handful of spinach or kale to the base (you'll barely taste it).</li>
                <li><strong>Chocolate Berry:</strong> Add 1 tablespoon of cacao powder to the base for a chocolate-berry flavor.</li>
                <li><strong>Tropical Twist:</strong> Replace half the berries with frozen mango or pineapple chunks.</li>
                <li><strong>Protein-Packed:</strong> Add 1 scoop of vanilla protein powder and an extra tablespoon of milk.</li>
                <li><strong>Autumn Bowl:</strong> Use frozen berries, add 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon, top with sliced apples and pumpkin seeds.</li>
