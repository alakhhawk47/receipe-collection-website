            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h3>Prepare ramekins</h3>
                    <p>Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C). Butter four 6-ounce ramekins thoroughly, then dust with cocoa powder, tapping out any excess. Place the prepared ramekins on a baking sheet.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Melt chocolate and butter</h3>
                    <p>In a medium heatproof bowl, combine the chocolate and butter. Melt together in the microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring between each, or over a pot of simmering water (double boiler). Stir until smooth, then set aside to cool slightly.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Mix wet ingredients</h3>
                    <p>In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, egg yolks, sugar, and vanilla extract until light and frothy, about 2-3 minutes.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Combine all ingredients</h3>
                    <p>Gently fold the melted chocolate mixture into the egg mixture until combined. Add the flour and salt, and fold just until no streaks remain, being careful not to overmix.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Fill ramekins</h3>
                    <p>Divide the batter evenly among the prepared ramekins, filling each about 3/4 full.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Bake</h3>
                    <p>Bake for 12-14 minutes, until the edges are firm but the centers are still soft. The tops should be set but will spring back when lightly touched.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Serve immediately</h3>
                    <p>Allow the cakes to rest for 1 minute. Run a knife around the edges to loosen, then carefully invert onto serving plates. Dust with additional cocoa powder or powdered sugar. Serve immediately with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream and garnish with fresh berries if desired.</p>

            <h2>Chef's Tips</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>For best results, use high-quality chocolate with at least 70% cocoa content.</li>
                <li>The baking time is crucial: too long and you'll lose the molten center, too short and the cake won't hold its shape.</li>
                <li>These cakes can be prepared ahead of time. Fill the ramekins with batter, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for up to 24 hours. Add 1-2 minutes to the baking time if baking from cold.</li>
                <li>For an extra flavor twist, add a pinch of espresso powder to the batter or a tablespoon of your favorite liqueur (like Grand Marnier or Baileys).</li>
